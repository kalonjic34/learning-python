# Learn Python Programming

This repository documents my progress as I learn Python.  I'm following a structured learning path, covering various concepts and practical applications.

## Course Outline

Here's a breakdown of the topics I'm covering:

1. **Stepping into the World of Python:** Introduction to the language, setting up the environment, and basic syntax. (in progress)
2. **Program Flow Control in Python:**  Learning about conditional statements (if, elif, else), loops (for, while), and control flow mechanisms. (in progress)
3. **Lists and Tuples:** Understanding data structures like lists and tuples, their differences, and how to use them effectively. (in progress)
4. **Functions An Introduction:**  Exploring functions, their purpose, how to define and call them, and the concept of modularity. (in progress)
5. **Dictionaries and Sets:**  Working with dictionaries (key-value pairs) and sets (unordered collections of unique elements). (in progress)
6. **Reading and writing files in Python:**  Learning how to interact with files, reading data from them, and writing data to them. (in progress)
7. **Modules and More on Functions:** Deepening my understanding of modules and advanced function concepts.  (Remaster in Progress) (in progress)
8. **Date and Time:**  Working with date and time objects, formatting, and manipulations. (Remaster in Progress) (in progress)
9. **Introduction to Tkinter:**  Getting started with GUI programming using Tkinter. (in progress)
10. **Object-Oriented Python:**  Understanding the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and applying them in Python. (in progress)
11. **Using Databases in Python:**  Learning how to connect to and interact with databases using Python. (in progress)
12. **Generators, Comprehensions, and the `timeit` module:**  Exploring advanced topics like generators, list comprehensions, and performance measurement using `timeit`. (in progress)
13. **Big O Notation:**  Understanding algorithm complexity and Big O notation. (in progress)
